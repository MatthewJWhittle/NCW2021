    "## Questions to answer:\n",
    "* Which city has had the biggest temperature change?\n",
    "* Which city has had the smallest temperature change?\n",
    "* Can you make a plot of annual temperature changes for each city or region?\n",
    "* Can you make a map of temperature changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Â The Data\n",
    "The dataset is a collection of daily temperature readings (daing back to 1995) from cities across the globe (split into 7 regions). It was [sourced from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities) ([original source](https://academic.udayton.edu/kissock/http/Weather/default.htm)) and tidied up a bit to encode missing values and remove data before 995 (there were some readings for year 200 making it difficult to work with). \n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset of monthly mean temperatures for each city is also included in the `data` folder. This is easier to work with because it is much smaller than the daily temperature files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "If you are new to R and the tidyverse, have a read through [this cheatsheet](http://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/c1fae72f-d2d7-4646-9dce-dd0f8fb5c5e8). It will give you the basics of processing and analysis.\n",

    "## Loading packages\n",
    "R is built on packages which do different things. To use them you need to load them with `library(package_name)`. The following are already installed, load them using this code: "
